## Mantra Sample Blog [with Autoform]
This repo is a fork of the Mantra Sample Blog application with the required changes to turn it into an application which uses [aldeed:SimpleSchema](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-simple-schema) and [Aluminati:meteor-react-autoform](https://github.com/Aluminati/meteor-react-autoform).

If you are unfamiliar with Mantra specification I strongly recommend checking out the [original sample](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app) app and the [Mantra specification](https://github.com/kadirahq/mantra) itself.

To find out what changes were done to the application to transfer it from a manual forum app to an autoform app please [review the commits](https://github.com/MechJosh0/mantra-sample-autoform-blog-app/commits/master).
